# Responsive Design Plan for TeachersGallery.com

Based on the design mockups and application needs, this document outlines our approach to creating a responsive experience across devices.

## Breakpoints

We'll use Tailwind's default breakpoints with some adjustments:

- **Mobile**: < 640px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: â‰¥ 1024px

## Layout Strategy

### Mobile First Approach
- Start with mobile layouts and progressively enhance for larger screens
- Use flexbox and grid for responsive layouts
- Implement fluid typography where appropriate

### Homepage
- Mobile: Single column card layout
- Tablet: Two column grid
- Desktop: Three or four column grid with larger cards

### Teacher Profile
- Mobile: Stacked layout with collapsed sections
- Desktop: Two-column layout with sidebar for contact/messaging options

### Navigation
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-out navigation
- Desktop: Horizontal navigation bar with dropdowns

### Onboarding Forms
- Mobile: Single column, one field per row
- Desktop: Two columns for related fields when appropriate

## Component Adaptations

### TeacherCard Component
- Mobile: Compact design with essential information
- Desktop: Larger with more details visible

### Forms
- Full width inputs on mobile
- Grouped inputs on desktop for related fields

### Messaging Interface
- Mobile: List view of conversations that expands to full screen chat
- Desktop: Side-by-side list and chat view

## Responsive Images

- Use Next.js Image component with responsive sizes
- Implement appropriate image sizing and quality for each breakpoint
- Consider art direction changes for certain key images

## Testing Plan

- Test on actual devices across different screen sizes
- Use browser dev tools for initial responsive testing
- Focus on critical user flows across devices:
  - Registration/onboarding
  - Browsing teachers
  - Viewing profiles
  - Messaging
  - Payment flow

## Implementation Notes

- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities consistently
- Avoid fixed widths/heights where possible
- Consider touch targets on mobile (min 44x44px)
- Ensure text readability across screen sizes (min 16px for body text on mobile)
- Test loading times on mobile networks

This plan will guide our responsive implementation as we build out the components and pages for TeachersGallery.com.
