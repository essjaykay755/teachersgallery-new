## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The review system uses a new `reviews` collection in Firestore with the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the review
- `teacherId`: The ID of the teacher being reviewed
- `reviewerId`: The ID of the user leaving the review
- `reviewerName`: The name of the reviewer
- `reviewerType`: Either 'student' or 'parent'
- `reviewerAvatarUrl`: Optional URL to the reviewer's avatar
- `rating`: Numeric rating from 1-5
- `comment`: Text content of the review
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the review was created

### Teacher Rating System
- The system calculates an average rating for each teacher
- When a new review is added, the teacher's rating is automatically updated
- The rating is displayed on teacher cards and profiles
- Reviews are ordered by most recent first

### Firestore Indexes
- Created a composite index for `reviews` collection:
  - Fields: `teacherId` (ascending) + `createdAt` (descending)
  - Required for the query that fetches reviews sorted by date

## Future Improvements
- Add ability for teachers to respond to reviews
- Implement review moderation system
- Add filtering and sorting options for reviews
- Allow users to edit or delete their own reviews
- Add helpful/not helpful voting for reviews
