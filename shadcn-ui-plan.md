# Shadcn UI Component Library Plan for TeachersGallery.com

This document outlines our plan to leverage Shadcn UI components for TeachersGallery.com. Shadcn provides accessible, customizable components that we'll adapt to match our design specifications.

## Shadcn Installation and Setup

1. Set up Shadcn components in our Next.js project
2. Configure with our custom theme from tailwind-config-analysis.md
3. Add necessary dependencies for component functionality

## Core Components to Include

### Form Components
- **Button**: For all actions (primary, secondary, outline, ghost variants)
- **Input**: Text input fields for forms
- **Select**: Dropdown selection for subjects, areas, etc.
- **Checkbox**: For agreement fields and multi-select options
- **RadioGroup**: For single-selection options
- **Textarea**: For message composition and longer text inputs
- **Form**: For validation and form handling
- **Label**: Accessible form labels
- **Switch**: Toggle components for visibility options

### Layout Components
- **Card**: Base for TeacherCard and other card-based UIs
- **Sheet**: Side panels for mobile navigation
- **Dialog**: Modal windows for confirmations
- **Popover**: For tooltips and small information displays
- **Tabs**: For organizing dashboard sections
- **Avatar**: For user profile images

### Navigation Components
- **NavigationMenu**: Main site navigation
- **DropdownMenu**: For user account options
- **Breadcrumb**: For navigation paths in multi-step forms

### Feedback Components
- **Toast**: For notifications and feedback messages
- **Alert**: For important information and warnings

### Data Display Components
- **Table**: For message history and other tabular data
- **Badge**: For status indicators (e.g., featured teacher)

## Custom Components to Build

Beyond the Shadcn base components, we'll create custom composite components:

1. **TeacherCard**: Based on Card component with custom styling
2. **OnboardingStepIndicator**: For visualizing onboarding progress
3. **PhoneNumberRequestButton**: Custom button with status handling
4. **FeaturedBadge**: Special badge for featured teachers
5. **MessageComposer**: Input with send button for messaging
6. **PaymentButton**: Custom button for Razorpay integration

## Component Customization

We will customize the Shadcn components to match our brand by:

1. Adjusting the color palette to match our primary and secondary colors
2. Modifying border radius, shadows, and other visual properties
3. Ensuring consistent spacing and typography
4. Adding custom animations where appropriate

## Implementation Strategy

1. Install core Shadcn components at the beginning of the project
2. Create a components test page to visualize all components with our custom theme
3. Build custom composite components as needed during development
4. Maintain a component documentation page for reference

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure all components have proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Support screen readers through proper labeling
- Test all components for accessibility compliance

By using Shadcn as our foundation, we'll maintain a consistent, accessible interface while customizing the look and feel to match TeachersGallery.com's brand identity.
